MiniBlooms
==========

This is a small, simple and fast implementation of bloom filters.  The default bloom filter implementation in Lua seems to dablooms, which were good to get me started but they are too large and slow for my purposes, so miniblooms were born.

## Build

    make

Hopefully something like this will eventually work, however I'm unfamiliar with luarocks so will have to take some time sometime to figure out how:

    sudo luarocks install miniblooms
